Validating synthetic population identifiers before reading.
Using population directory: $FRED_HOME/populations
FRED defines a "deme" to be a local population of people whose households are contained in the same bounded geographic region.
No Synthetic Population ID may have more than one Deme ID, but a Deme ID may contain many Synthetic Population IDs.
PARAMS: num_demes = 1
Split ID string "2010_ver1_42065" into 1 token using delimiter: ' '
Deme 0 comprises 1 synthetic population id:
